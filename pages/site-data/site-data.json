      "I'm a Front End Web Engineer. I also design for the web a little too. I've been working with the web since 2003 when I wrote my first line of HTML in the first semester of my BSc Interactive Multimedia Design degree at The University of Ulster, in Northern Ireland.",
      "Upon graduating in 2008 I moved to Leeds in West Yorkshire, England and joined a small agency called Xperience, before joining the Engineering team at Jet2.com and Jet2holidays.com.",
      "In January 2012, I headed for the bright lights of London, where I stayed primarily in the Ecommerce space until 2021. I've worked for Net A Porter, Stella & Dot and River Island. I'm currently working for Royal Borough of Greenwich council where I'm lead Front End Engineer in the Digital Product team.",
      "My skills and interests are in writing modern semantic HTML, crafting tight CSS or SCSS, and harnessing the power of a Javascript tech stack, where I have experience working, with React frameworks including NextJS, Redux, Frontity etc.",
      "In my spare time I can be found working on the occasional freelance project or learning yet another framework. Lately, I've been trying to write more and document my work, my projects and musings of interest... You can find them below."
